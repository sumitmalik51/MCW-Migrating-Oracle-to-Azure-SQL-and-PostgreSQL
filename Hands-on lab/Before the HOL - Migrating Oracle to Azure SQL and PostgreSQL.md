# Migrating Oracle to Azure SQL and PostgreSQL before the hands-on lab setup guide

## Requirements

- Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN.
  - Trial subscriptions will not work.
- A virtual machine configured with:
  - Visual Studio 2019 Community (latest release)

In this lab, there are three major migration paths:

  - Migrating Oracle to Azure SQL
  - Migrating SQL Server 2008 R2 Data Warehouse to Azure SQL (*homogenous* migration)
  - Migrating Oracle to Azure Database for PostgreSQL

Regardless of which path(s) you complete, follow Tasks 1-7. After that, the Task titles indicate which migration paths they are intended for.

## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 45 minutes

In the Before the hands-on lab exercise, you will set up your environment for use in the rest of the hands-on lab. You should follow all the steps provided in the Before the hands-on lab section to prepare your environment **before attending** the hands-on lab. Failure to do so will significantly impact your ability to complete the lab within the time allowed.

> **Important**: Most Azure resources require unique names. Throughout this lab, you will see the word “SUFFIX” as part of resource names. You should replace this with your Microsoft alias, initials, or another value to ensure the resource is uniquely named.

### Task 1: Provision a resource group

In this task, you will create an Azure resource group for the resources used throughout this lab.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Resource groups** from the Azure services list.

    ![Resource groups are highlighted in the Azure services list.](media/azure-services-resource-groups.png "Azure services")

2. On the Resource groups blade, select **+Add**.

    ![+Add is highlighted in the toolbar on the Resource groups blade.](media/resource-groups-add.png "Resource groups")

3. Enter the following in the Create an empty resource group blade:

    - **Subscription**: Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab.
    - **Resource group**: Enter hands-on-lab-SUFFIX.
    - **Region**: Select the region you would like to use for resources in this hands-on lab. Remember this location so you can use it for the other resources you'll provision throughout this lab.

    ![Add Resource group Resource groups is highlighted in the navigation pane of the Azure portal, +Add is highlighted in the Resource groups blade, and "hands-on-labs" is entered into the Resource group name box on the Create an empty resource group blade.](./media/create-resource-group.png "Create resource group")

4. Select **Review + Create**.

5. On the Review + Create tab, select **Create** to provision the resource group.

### Task 2: Register the Microsoft DataMigration resource provider

In this task, you will register the `Microsoft.DataMigration` resource provider with your subscription in Azure. Azure Database Migration Service is used for the optional homogenous data migration.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), navigate to the Home page and then select **Subscriptions** from the Navigate list found midway down the page.

    ![Subscriptions are highlighted in the Navigate menu.](media/azure-navigate-subscriptions.png "Navigate menu")

2. Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab from the list, select **Resource providers**, enter "migration" into the filter box, and then select **Register** next to **Microsoft.DataMigration**.

    ![The Subscription blade is displayed, with Resource providers selected and highlighted under Settings. On the Resource providers blade, migration is entered into the filter box, and Register is highlighted next to Microsoft.DataMigration.](media/azure-portal-subscriptions-resource-providers-register-microsoft-datamigration.png "Resource provider registration")

### Task 3: Deploy the Lab ARM Template 

This lab uses an ARM template to automate the setup of lab resources. In this task, you will learn how to configure the ARM template.

1. Select the **Deploy to Azure** button to open the ARM template in the Azure portal.

    [![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmicrosoft%2FMCW-Migrating-Oracle-to-Azure-SQL-and-PostgreSQL%2Fmaster%2FHands-on%2520lab%2Flab-files%2FARM%2Ftemplate.json)

2. Before you deploy the ARM template, you need to provide multiple parameters.

   - **Subscription**: Select the Azure subscription you are using to complete the lab
   - **Resource group**: Select the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group you created earlier
   - **Region**: This will auto-populate depending on the region you created your resource group in
   - **Unique Suffix**: Since certain Azure resources require globally unique names, provide a short suffix that does not end with a number or hyphen
   - **VM Password**: This will be used for the Lab VM, and if you are completing the optional homogenous migration, the SQL Server 2008 R2 VM
   - **Postgre SQL Password**: This is the administrator password for the PostgreSQL instance. If you don't provide a value, it will just be the `VM Password` you provided
   - **Azure SQL Password**: This is the administrator password for the Azure SQL Database instance. Again, it will default to the `VM Password` value

    ![Deploy the ARM template with the parameters shown above.](./media/no-optional-resource-deployment-arm.png "ARM template deployment parameters")

3. Select **Review + create**. Let validation pass.

4. Select **Create**. It should take 10-20 minutes to deploy, depending on whether you deploy the optional homogenous migration resources.

### Task 4: Connect to the Lab VM

In this task, you will create an RDP connection to your Lab virtual machine (VM) and disable Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Resource groups** from the Azure services list.

    ![Resource groups are highlighted in the Azure services list.](media/azure-services-resource-groups.png "Azure services")

4. Navigate to the directory where the zipped instant client packages reside.

    - For the basic package, right-click it, and select **Extract All...**.
    - When prompted to choose the destination directory, navigate to the `C:\` location.
    - Select **Extract**.
    - Repeat this process for the zipped SDK.

    ![Screenshot to show the process of installing client and SDK Packages.](./media/installing-basic-instantclient-package.png "Client and SDK package downloads")

    Your folder path should show:

    ![The image shows the folder path to the client and the SDK.](media/extract-sdk-client-validation.png "Correct path to the SDK and Instant Client")

5. Install the Git client and ora2pg utility.  
    - Return to the PowerShell script.
    - Press any key to terminate the script's execution, if the PS window is still visible.
    - Open Explorer and rename the  `C:\instantclient_12_2` folder to `C:\instantclient`.
    - Launch the script one more time for install path validation purposes.
    - If the previous steps were successful, the script should be able to locate **oci.dll** under `C:\instantclient\oci.dll`.

        >**Note**: If the script still cannot find `oci.dll`, rename the Instant Client extract folder name to `C:\instantclient` exactly.

    ![The image shows the script expects an exact Instant Client install path.](media/ps-validation-path-instant-client.png "Instant Client install path")

    If the path is correct, you should see the script downloading the Git installer.

    ![The image shows the Git installer downloading.](media/ps-downloading-git-installer.png "Downloading Git installer")

    >**Note**: The script may throw errors of not being able to find a Git executable at a certain location. This should not impact the installation.

    A successful installation should have a PowerShell screen that resembles this:

    ![The image shows a successful Git and ora2pg installation](media/ps-successful-git-ora2pg-installation.png "Git and ora2pg installation")

6. Once ora2pg installs, you will need to configure PATH variables.

    - Search for **View advanced system settings** in Windows.
    - Select the result, and the **System Properties** dialog box should open.
    - By default, the **Advanced** tab should be showing, but if not, navigate to it.
    - Then, select **Environment Variables...**.

    ![Screenshot showing process to enter environment labels.](./media/enter-environment-variables.png "Environment Variables selected")

7. Under **System variables**, select **Path**. Select **Edit...**.

    ![Screenshot to show editing the path variables.](./media/selecting-path.png "Selecting the PATH variables")

8. The **Edit environment variable** box should be displaying.

    - Select **New**.
    - Enter **C:\instantclient**.
    - Repeat this process, but enter **%%PATH%%** instead.
