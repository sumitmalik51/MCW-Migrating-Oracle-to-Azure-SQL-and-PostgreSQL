# Migrating Oracle to Azure SQL hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you implement a proof of concept (POC) for conducting a site analysis for a customer to compare cost, performance, and level of effort required to migrate from Oracle to SQL Server. You evaluate the dependent applications and reports that need to be updated and come up with a migration plan. Also, you help the customer take advantage of new SQL Server features to improve performance and resiliency and perform a migration from an old version of SQL Server to Azure SQL Database.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to design and build a database migration plan and implement any required application changes associated with changing database technologies.

## Overview

Wide World Importers (WWI) has experienced significant growth in the last few years. In addition to predictable growth, they’ve had a substantial amount of growth in the data they store in their data warehouse. Their data warehouse is starting to show its age, slowing down during extract, transform, and load (ETL) operations and during critical queries. The data warehouse is running on SQL Server 2008 R2 Standard Edition.

The WWI CIO has recently read about new performance enhancements of Azure SQL Database and SQL Server 2017. She is excited about the potential performance improvements related to clustered ColumnStore indexes. She is also hoping that table compression can improve performance and backup times.

WWI is concerned about upgrading their database to Azure SQL Database or SQL Server 2017. The data warehouse has been successful for a long time. As it has grown, it has filled with data, stored procedures, views, and security. WWI wants assurance that if it moves its data store, it won’t run into any incompatibilities with the storage engine of Azure SQL Database or SQL Server 2017.

WWI’s CIO would like a POC of a data warehouse move and proof that the new technology can help ETL and query performance.

## Solution architecture

Below is a diagram of the solution architecture you build in this lab. Please study this carefully, so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

![This solution diagram is divided into Microsoft Azure and on-premises. Microsoft Azure includes two Azure SQL Database instances and the Azure Data Factory SSIS Integration Runtime to execute SSIS packages hosted in Azure Files. It also includes Azure Analysis Services, Power BI, and SSRS on an Azure VM as a lift-and-shift alternative to Power BI for their reporting needs. On-premises includes the following elements: API App for vendor connections; Web App for Internet Sales Transactions; ASP.NET Core App for inventory management; and Excel for reporting.](./media/new-suggested-architecture.png "Preferred Solution diagram")

The Oracle XE database supporting the application will be migrated to an Azure SQL Database instance using SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) 8.x for Oracle. Once the Oracle database has been migrated, the Northwind MVC application will be updated, so it targets Azure SQL Database instead of Oracle. The entity models are updated against Azure SQL Database, new controllers and views are scaffolded, and code updates are made to use the new Entity Framework Core context. Corrections to stored procedures are made due to differences in how stored procedures are accessed in Oracle PL/SQL versus T-SQL.

For the homogenous migration, the solution begins with using the Microsoft Data Migration Assistant to assess what potential issues might exist for upgrading the database to Azure SQL Database. After correcting any problems, the SQL Server 2008 R2 database is migrated to Azure SQL Database using the Azure Database Migration Service. Two features of Azure SQL Database, Table Compression and ColumnStore Index, will be applied to demonstrate value and performance improvements from the upgrade. For the ColumnStore Index, a new table based on the existing FactResellerSales table will be created, and a ColumnStore index applied. 

## Requirements

- Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN.
  - Trial subscriptions will not work.
- A virtual machine configured with Visual Studio 2019 Community edition.

## Exercise 1: Setup Oracle 18c Express Edition

Duration: 45 minutes

In this exercise, you will load a sample database supporting the application. Ensure that you installed Oracle XE, Oracle Data Access Components, and Oracle SQL Developer, as detailed in the Before the Hands-on Lab documents.

### Task 1: Create the Northwind database in Oracle 18c XE

WWI has provided you with a copy of their application, including a database script to create their Oracle database. They have asked that you use this as a starting point for migrating their database and application to Azure SQL DB. In this task, you will create a connection to the Oracle database on your Lab VM.

1. In a web browser on LabVM, download a copy of the [Migrating Oracle to  Azure SQL and PostgreSQL upgrade and migration MCW repo](https://github.com/saimachi/MCW-Migrating-Oracle-to-Azure-SQL-and-PostgreSQL/archive/refs/heads/september-2021-update.zip).

2. Unzip the contents to **C:\handsonlab**.

3. Launch SQL Developer from the `C:\Tools\sqldeveloper` path from earlier. In the **Database Connection** window, select **Create a Connection Manually**.

   ![Manual connection creation in Oracle SQL Developer.](./media/create-connection-sql-developer.png "SQL Developer add connection manually")

4. Provide the following parameters to the **New / Select Database Connection** window. Select **Connect** when you are complete.

   - **Name**: Northwind
   - **Username**: system
   - **Password**: Password.1!!
   - Keep the **Details** at their defaults

   ![Northwind connection in SQL Developer.](./media/new-oracle-connection-sqldeveloper.png "Northwind connection")

5. Once the connection completes, select the **Open File** icon (1). Navigate to `C:\handsonlab\MCW-Migrating-Oracle-to-Azure-SQL-and-PostgreSQL-master\Hands-on lab\lab-files\starter-project\Oracle Scripts\1.northwind.oracle.schema`. Then, execute the DDL statements (2).

   ![Execute schema creation script in SQL Developer.](./media/execute-first-northwind-sql-script.png "Schema creation script")

6. Right-click the **Northwind** connection and select **Properties**. Then, edit the **Username** to `NW`, and the **Password** to `oracledemo123`. Select **Connect**. Note that you may be asked to enter the password again.

7. In the Open File dialog, navigate to `C:\handsonlab\MCW-Migrating-Oracle-to-Azure-SQL-and-PostgreSQL-master\Hands-on lab\lab-files\starter-project\Oracle Scripts`, select the file `2.northwind.oracle.tables.views.sql`, and then select **Open**.

8. As you did previously, run the script. Note that SQL Developer provides an output pane to view any errors.

   ![Script output of the second Northwind database script.](./media/northwind-script-2-output.png "SQL Developer output pane")

9. Repeat steps 7 - 8, replacing the file name in step 26 with each of the following:

    - `3.northwind.oracle.packages.sql`

    - `4.northwind.oracle.sps.sql`

      - During the Execute script step for this file, you will need to execute each CREATE OR REPLACE statement independently.

      - Using your mouse, select the first statement, starting with CREATE and going to END. Then, run the selection, as highlighted in the image.

      ![The first statement between CREATE and END is highlighted, along with the selection execution button.](./media/sqldeveloper-execute-first-query.png "Select and execute the first statement")

      - Repeat this for each of the remaining CREATE OR REPLACE... END; blocks in the script file (there are 7 more to execute, for 8 total).

    - `5.northwind.oracle.seed.sql`

      > **Important**: This query can take several minutes to run, so make sure you wait until you see the **Commit complete** message in the output window before executing the next file.

    - `6.northwind.oracle.constraints.sql`

10. After you finish running these scripts, validate that the database objects were created. The image below demonstrates the Tables and the Views created by the script.

    ![Presenting the tables and views generated by the Oracle scripts.](./media/views-table-validation.png "Oracle tables and views")

### Task 2: Configure the Starter Application to use Oracle

In this task, you will add the necessary configuration to the `NorthwindMVC` solution to connect to the Oracle database you created in the previous task.

1. In Visual Studio on your LabVM, select **Build** from the menu, then select **Build Solution**.

   ![Build Solution is highlighted in the Build menu in Visual Studio.](./media/visual-studio-menu-build-build-solution.png "Select Build Solution")

2. Open the `appsettings.json` file in the `NorthwindMVC` project by double-clicking the file in the Solution Explorer, on the right-hand side in Visual Studio.

3. In the `appsettings.json` file, locate the `ConnectionStrings` section, and verify the connection string named **OracleConnectionString** matches the values you have used in this hands-on lab:

   ```xml
   DATA SOURCE=localhost:1521/XE;PASSWORD=oracledemo123;USER ID=NW
   ```

   ```json
   "ConnectionStrings": {
      "OracleConnectionString": "DATA SOURCE=localhost:1521/XE;PASSWORD=oracledemo123;USER ID=NW"
   }
   ```

4. Run the solution by selecting the green **Start** button on the Visual Studio toolbar.

   ![Start is selected on the toolbar.](./media/visual-studio-toolbar-start.png "Run the solution")

5. You should see the Northwind Traders Dashboard load in your browser.

   ![The Northwind Traders Dashboard is visible in a browser.](./media/northwind-traders-dashboard.png "View the dashboard")

6. Close the browser to stop debugging the application, and return to Visual Studio.

## Exercise 2: Assess the Oracle 18c Database before Migrating to Azure SQL Database

Duration: 15 mins

In this exercise, you will prepare the existing Oracle database for its migration to Azure SQL DB. Preparation involves two main steps. The first step is to update the database statistics. Statistics about the database become outdated as data volumes and activity change over time. Second, you will need to identify invalid objects in the Oracle database to minimize disturbances to the migration.

### Task 1: Update Statistics and Identify Invalid Objects

1. Launch SQL Developer. Open the **Northwind** database connection.

2. Create a new SQL file using the **New** button (1). Select **Database Files** (2) and **SQL File** (3). Select **OK** (4). 

    ![Creating a new SQL script in Oracle SQL Developer](./media/creating-new-sql-file-sqldev.png "New SQL file")
   
3. Call the new SQL File `update-18c-stats.sql`. Save it in a location of your choice, such as the `Oracle Scripts` directory from earlier.

4. Now, you will populate the new file with the following statements. Run the file as you did when you populated database objects.

    ```sql
    -- 18c script
    EXECUTE DBMS_STATS.GATHER_SCHEMA_STATS(ownname => 'NW');
    EXECUTE DBMS_STATS.GATHER_DATABASE_STATS;
    EXECUTE DBMS_STATS.GATHER_DICTIONARY_STATS;
    ```

    >**Note**: This script can take over one minute to run. Ensure that you receive confirmation that that the script has executed successfully.

5. Now, we will utilize a query that lists database objects that are invalid. It is recommended to fix any errors and compile the objects before starting the migration process. Create a new file named `show-invalid-objects.sql` and save it in the same directory. Run this query to find all of the invalid objects.

    ```sql
    SELECT owner, object_type, object_name
    FROM all_objects
    WHERE status = 'INVALID';
    ```

    >**Note**: You should not see any invalid objects.

## Exercise 3: Migrate the Oracle database to Azure SQL Database

Duration: 30 minutes

In this exercise, you will migrate the Oracle database to Azure SQL DB using SSMA.

### Task 1: Migrate the Oracle database to Azure SQL Database using SSMA

1. On your LabVM, launch **Microsoft SQL Server Migration Assistant for Oracle** from the Start Menu.

2. Select **File**, then **New Project...**

   ![File and New Project are highlighted in the SQL Server Migration Assistant for Oracle.](./media/ssma-menu-file-new-project.png "Select New Project")

3. In the New Project dialog, accept the default name and location, select **Azure SQL Database** for the Migrate To value, and select **OK**.

   ![In the New Project dialog box, Azure SQL DB is selected and highlighted in the Migration To box.](./media/ssma-new-project.png "New Project dialog box")

4. Select **Connect to Oracle** in the SSMA toolbar.

   ![Connect to Oracle is highlighted on the SSMA toolbar.](./media/ssma-toolbar-connect-to-oracle.png "Select Connect to Oracle")

5. In the Connect to Oracle dialog, enter the following:

   - **Provider**: Leave set to the default value, Oracle Data Provider for .NET.
   - **Mode**: Leave set to Standard mode.
   - **Server name**: localhost
   - **Server port**: Set to 1521.
   - **Oracle SID**: XE
   - **Username**: NW
   - **Password**: oracledemo123

   ![The information above is entered in the Connect to Oracle dialog box, and Connect is selected at the bottom.](./media/ssma-connect-to-oracle.png "Specify the settings")

   >**Note**: You can also connect to SSMA using a connection string through the **Mode** dropdown. Irrespective of how you connect to Oracle from SSMA, using the **Oracle Data Provider for .NET** is the best-practice technology.

6. Select **Connect**.

7. In the Filter objects dialog, uncheck **Load all user objects**. Then, select the **NW** schema. Note that the **Sys** and **System** schemas are automatically checked. 

   ![The NW schema is highlighted and checked in the Filter objects dialog. The System schema is checked, and all others are unchecked.](media/ssms-filter-objects.png "SSMA Filter objects")

   >**Note**: In production Oracle environments, you must ensure that you have sufficient permissions to run SSMA. See Microsoft's complete list [here.](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/ssma/oracle/connecting-to-oracle-database-oracletosql)

8. In the Output window, you will see a message that the connection was established successfully, similar to the following:

   ![The successful connection message is highlighted in the Output window.](./media/ssma-connect-to-oracle-success.png "View the successful connection message")

9. Under Oracle Metadata Explorer, expand the localhost node, Schemas, and confirm you can see the NW schema, which will be the source for the migration.

   ![The NW schema is highlighted in Oracle Metadata Explorer.](./media/ssma-oracle-metadata-explorer-nw.png "Confirm the NW schema")

10. In the Oracle Metadata Explorer, check the box next to NW, expand the NW database, and uncheck **Packages**. Next, select NW to make sure it is selected in the tree.

    ![The NW schema is selected and highlighted in Oracle Metadata Explorer.](./media/ssma-oracle-metadata-explorer-nw-selected.png "Confirm the NW schema")

11. Right-click the **NW** schema. Select **Create Report**. SSMA will use the metadata it has compiled about objects in the **NW** schema to produce a useful report. SSMA also allows you to create reports at the object-level.

12. Once the report is generated, expand the hierarchy on the left-hand side of the page. Select an object that is marked by an error, such as the `CUSTORDERSDETAILS` procedure. On the left side, observe the PL/SQL code, and on the right side, observe the T-SQL code generated by SSMA.
    
    ![CUSTORDERDETAILS stored procedure in the SSMA HTML report.](./media/custorderdetails-assessment.png "Stored procedure in SSMA HTML report")

13. You can use the report to navigate through the issues that SSMA encountered during the conversion. Use the error navigation tool highlighted in the **Source** tab.

    ![Error navigation tool in the SSMA HTML report.](./media/error-navigation-ssma.png "Error navigation tool on the Source tab")

14. Note that while SSMA can generate an HTML report, it can also generate an XML file that may be suited better to your migration environment. With the default SSMA installation, you can find the XML report in the following location: `C:\Users\demouser\Documents\SSMAProjects\[PROJECT NAME]\report\[REPORT NAME]\report.xml`.

    Here is an image of an XML report in Excel.

    ![XML report generated by SSMA opened in Excel.](./media/xml-report.png "XML report")

15. Next, select **Connect to Azure SQL Database** from the SSMA toolbar, to add your Azure SQL DB connection.

    ![Connect to Azure SQL Database is highlighted on the toolbar.](./media/connect-to-azure-sql-db.png "Connect to Azure SQL DB")

16. In the Connect to Azure SQL Database dialog, provide the following:

    - **Server name**: Enter the DNS name of your Azure SQL DB. It is going to be `northwind-server-[SUFFIX].database.windows.net`, where `[SUFFIX]` represents the parameter you provided to the ARM template.

    - **Database**: Northwind
    - **Authentication**: Set to **SQL Server Authentication**
      - **Username**: `demouser`
      - **Password**: Use the value you provided to the ARM template
    - **Encrypt Connection**: Check this box.
    - **Trust Server Certificate**: Check this box.

    ![The information above is entered in the Connect to Azure SQL Database dialog box, and Connect is selected at the bottom.](./media/azure-sql-db-params.png "Specify the settings")

17. Select **Connect**.

18. You will see a success message in the output window.

    ![The successful connection message is highlighted in the Output window.](./media/ssma-connect-to-sql-server-success.png "View the successful connection message")

19. In the Azure SQL Database Metadata Explorer, expand the server node, then Databases. You should see Northwind listed.

    ![Northwind is highlighted under Databases in Azure SQL Database Metadata Explorer.](./media/azure-sql-db-metadata-explorer.png "Verify the Northwind listing")

20. In the Azure SQL Database Metadata explorer, check the box next to Northwind.

    ![Northwind is selected and highlighted under Databases in Azure SQL DB Metadata Explorer.](./media/northwind-db-metadata-explorer.png "Select Northwind")

21. In the SSMA toolbar, select **Convert Schema**. There is a bug in SSMA which prevents this button to being properly enabled, so if the button is disabled, you can select the NW node in the Oracle Metadata Explorer, which should cause the Convert Schema button to become enabled. You can also right-click on the NW database in the Oracle Metadata Explorer, and select Convert Schema if that does not work.

    ![Convert Schema is highlighted on the SSMA toolbar.](./media/ssma-toolbar-convert-schema.png "Select Convert Schema")

22. After about a minute the conversion should have completed.

23. In the Azure SQL Database Metadata Explorer, observe that new schema objects have been added. For example, under Northwind, Schemas, NW, Tables you should see the tables from the Oracle database. Note that these objects have not been persisted to the Azure SQL Database instance yet.

    ![NW is selected in the Azure SQL Database Metadata Explorer, and tables from the Oracle database are visible below that.](./media/azure-sql-metadata-explorer-nw-tables.png "Observe new schema objects")

24. In the output pane, you will notice a message that the conversion finished with no errors and 17 warnings.

    ![The conversion message is highlighted in the Output window.](./media/ssma-convert-schema-output.png "View the conversion message")

    It is important to note the meaning of errors and warnings. They are not issues with the SSMA program; they indicate objects that cannot be migrated automatically by SSMA or important considerations as you complete the migration. [Here](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/ssma/oracle/messages/o2ss0007) is an example SSMA error code in the Microsoft documentation.

25. **Optional**: Save the project. This can take a while, and is not necessary to complete the hands-on lab.

26. To apply the resultant schema to the Northwind database in Azure SQL Database, use the Azure SQL Database Metadata Explorer to view the Northwind database. Right-click Northwind, and select **Synchronize with Database**.

    ![Synchronize with Database is highlighted in the submenu of the Northwind database in Azure SQL Database Metadata Explorer.](./media/ssma-synchronize-with-database.png "Select Synchronize with Database")

27. Select **OK** in the Synchronize with the Database dialog. Wait until you see **Synchronization operation is complete** in the output window.

28. Now you need to migrate the data. In the Oracle Metadata Explorer, select **NW** and from the command bar, select **Migrate Data**.

    ![Migrate Data is highlighted in the command bar of Oracle Metadata Explorer.](./media/ssma-toolbar-migrate-data.png "Select Migrate Data")

29. You will be prompted to re-enter your Oracle credentials for use by the migration connection.

    - Recall the Oracle credentials are:

      - **Server name**: localhost
      - **Server port**: 1521
      - **Oracle SID**: XE
      - **Username**: NW
      - **Password**: oracledemo123

    - The Azure SQL Database credentials are:

      - **Server name**: Follows the format `northwind-server-[SUFFIX].database.windows.net`
      - **Authentication**: SQL Server Authentication
        - **Username**: `demouser`
        - **Password**: Use the value you provided to the ARM template

30. Select **Connect**.

31. After the migration completes, you will be presented with a Data Migration Report, similar to the following:

    ![This is screenshot of an example Data Migration Report.](./media/ssma-data-migration-report.png "View the Data Migration Report")

32. Select **Close** on the migration report.

### Task 2: Additional SSMA Usage Details

This lab explores a relatively simple migration. This Task will provide additional considerations that you can refer to as you attempt more complex migrations.

1. To facilitate the migration, SSMA migrates certain .NET assemblies to the target Azure SQL Database instance, as indicated by the first image. Be mindful that SQL Server 2017 and above enforce *CLR strict security*, which you must consider during your migration. As you complete other migrations, be mindful of errors such as the second image.

   ![Migrated assemblies in Azure SQL Database.](./media/assemblies-in-azure-sql-db.png "Migrated assemblies")

   ![CLR Strict Security causes .NET assembly migration to fail.](./media/ssma-synchronize-errors.png "CLR strict security")

2. To help you resolve errors during your migrations, utilize SSMA's comprehensive logs. Follow the steps below to access them.
   
   - Select **Tools** in the upper left-hand corner of SSMA 
   - Select **Global Settings**
   - Select the **Logging** tab on the **Global Settings** window
   - Observe the **Log file path**

   ![Locating the log file path in SSMA.](./media/ssma-log-file-location.png "SSMA log file path")

3. Besides the default data integrity mechanism in SSMA (comparing hashes), SSMA also provides a powerful testing suite that follows the flow outlined below.

   - Initialize test case
   - Select and configure objects
   - Select and configure affected objects
   - Call Ordering
   - Finalize test case

   Access the **Test Case Wizard**, which guides you through these steps, by selecting **Tester** and **New Test Case**.

   ![Launching the test case wizard in SSMA.](./media/test-case-wizard.png "Test case wizard")

4. Note that SSMA for Oracle also allows developers to port ad-hoc queries from Oracle to the target database engine syntax, T-SQL. To do this, in the Oracle Metadata Explorer, right-click **Statements** and select **Add Statement**.

5. In the statement editor window, paste the following code. The Oracle `ROWNUM` pseudo-column limits the number of rows in the result set. 

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM NW.CATEGORIES
   WHERE ROWNUM <= 5;
   ```

   ![Oracle statement in the SSMA Statement editor.](./media/oracle-statement-ssma.png "Oracle statement with ROWNUM")

6. Right-click the new statement in the Oracle Metadata Explorer and select **Convert Schema**. Immediately, a T-SQL version of the statement should appear next to the **Azure SQL Database Metadata Explorer**.

   Notice how the `ROWNUM` Oracle pseudo-column is substituted for the T-SQL `TOP` keyword.
   
   ```sql
   SELECT TOP (5) CATEGORIES.CATEGORYID, CATEGORIES.CATEGORYNAME, CATEGORIES.DESCRIPTION, CATEGORIES.PICTURE
   FROM NW.CATEGORIES
   GO
   ```

7. Just like other objects it migrates, SSMA produces a report for the statement conversion. Simply select the **Report** tab.

   ![Statement conversion report.](./media/report-for-statement-conversion.png "Statement conversion report")

## Exercise 4: Migrate the Application

Duration: 15 minutes

In this exercise, you will modify the `NorthwindMVC` application so it targets Azure SQL Database instead of Oracle.

### Task 1: Create new Entity Models against Azure SQL Database and Scaffold Views

1. On your Lab VM, return to Visual Studio, and open `appsettings.json` from the Solution Explorer.

2. Add a connection string called `AzureSqlConnectionString`. Ensure that it correctly references the remote Azure SQL Database credentials.

   - Replace the value of `Server` with your Azure SQL Database DNS name
   - Verify the value of `Password` is set

   ```json
   "ConnectionStrings": {
      "OracleConnectionString": "DATA SOURCE=localhost:1521/XE;PASSWORD=oracledemo123;USER ID=NW",
      "AzureSqlConnectionString": "Server={Server},1433;Initial Catalog=Northwind;Persist Security Info=False;User ID=demouser;Password={Password};MultipleActiveResultSets=False;Encrypt=True;TrustServerCertificate=False;Connection Timeout=30;"
   }
   ```

3. Save the `appsettings.json` file.

    >**Note**: In production scenarios, it is not recommended to store connection strings in files that are checked into version control. Consider using Azure Key Vault references in production and [user secrets](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets) in development.

4. Open the Package Manager console by selecting **Tools** (1), **NuGet Package Manager** (2), and **Package Manager Console** (3).

    ![Opening the Package Manager console in Visual Studio.](./media/open-pmc.png "Opening the Package Manager Console")

5. Enter the following command in the Package Manager console to create the models. The `-Force` flag eliminates the need to manually clear the `Data` directory.

    ```powershell
    Scaffold-DbContext Name=ConnectionStrings:AzureSqlConnectionString Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer -OutputDir Data -Context DataContext -Schemas NW -Force
    ```

    >**Note**: This command will reverse-engineer more tables than are actually needed. The `-Tables` flag, referencing schema-qualified table names, provides a more accurate approach.

6. Attempt to build the solution to identify errors.

    ![Errors in the solution.](./media/solution-errors.png "Solution errors")

7. Expand the **Views** folder. Delete the following folders, each of which contain five views:

   - **Customers**
   - **Employees**
   - **Products**
   - **Shippers**
   - **Suppliers**

8. Expand the **Controllers** folder. Delete all controllers, except **HomeController.cs**.

9. Open **DataContext.cs**. Add the following line to the top of the file, below the other `using` directives.

    ```csharp
    using NorthwindMVC.Models;
    ```

    Add the following below the other property definitions.

    ```csharp
    // Existing property definitions
    public virtual DbSet<Supplier> Suppliers { get; set; }
    public virtual DbSet<Territory> Territories { get; set; }

    // Add SalesByYearDbSet
    public virtual DbSet<SalesByYear> SalesByYearDbSet { get; set; }
    ```

    Lastly, add the following statement to the `OnModelCreating()` method, after setting the collation information. 

    ```csharp
    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        // Collation information

        // Add this:
        modelBuilder.Entity<SalesByYear>(entity =>
        {
            entity.HasNoKey();
        });

        // Other Fluent API configuration
    }
    ```

10. Build the solution. Ensure that no errors appear. We added `SalesByYearDbSet` to **DataContext** because **HomeController.cs** references it. We deleted the controllers and their associated views because we will scaffold them again from the models.

11. Right-click the **Controllers** folder and select **Add** (1). Select **New Scaffolded Item...** (2).

   ![Adding a new scaffolded item.](./media/add-scaffolded-item.png "New scaffolded item")

12. Select **MVC Controller with views, using Entity Framework**. Then, select **Add**.

   ![Add MVC Controller with Views, using Entity Framework.](./media/add-mvc-with-ef.png "MVC Controller with Views, using Entity Framework")

13. In the **ADD MVC Controller with views, using Entity Framework** dialog box, provide the following details. Then, select **Add**. Visual Studio will build the project.

    - **Model class**: Select `Customer`
    - **Data context class**: Select `DataContext`
    - Select all three checkboxes below **Views**
    - **Controller name**: Keep it set to `CustomersController`

   ![Scaffolding controllers and views from model classes.](./media/customer-scaffold-views.png "Scaffolding controllers and views")

14. Repeat steps 11-13, according to the following details:

    - **EmployeesController.cs**
      - Based on the **Employee** model class
    - **ProductsController.cs**
      - Based on the **Product** model class
    - **ShippersController.cs**
      - Based on the **Shipper** model class
    - **SuppliersController.cs**
      - Based on the **Supplier** model class

15. Navigate to **Startup.cs**. Ensure that SQL Server is configured as the correct provider and the appropriate connection string is referenced.

    ```csharp
    // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to add services to the container.
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddControllersWithViews();

        // Verify this line:
        services.AddDbContext<DataContext>(options => options.UseSqlServer(Configuration.GetConnectionString("AzureSqlConnectionString")));
    }
    ```

### Task 2: Ensure Application Compatibility with the Stored Procedure

4. Observe that the query returns results, showing the data has been migrated from the on-premises SQL Server 2008 R2 database into Azure SQL Database.

5. Leave SSMS open with the connection to your Azure SQL Database for the next exercise.

## Exercise 7: Post upgrade enhancement (Optional Homogenous Migration)

Duration: 20 minutes

In this exercise, you will demonstrate value from the upgrade by enabling the Table Compression and ColumnStore Index features of Azure SQL Database.

### Task 1: Table compression

1. In SSMS on the SqlServer2008 VM, and connect to your Azure SQL Database.

2. Open a new query window by selecting **New Query** from the toolbar.

   ![The New Query icon is highlighted on the SSMS toolbar.](./media/ssms-toolbar-new-query.png "SSMS New Query")

3. Copy the script below, and paste it into the query window:

   ```sql
   USE [WideWorldImportersDW]

   -- Get the Size of the FactInternetSales table
   SELECT
   t.Name AS TableName,
   p.rows AS RowCounts,
   CAST(ROUND((SUM(a.total_pages) / 128.00), 2) AS NUMERIC(36, 2)) AS Size_MB
   FROM sys.tables t
   INNER JOIN sys.indexes i ON t.OBJECT_ID = i.object_id
   INNER JOIN sys.partitions p ON i.object_id = p.OBJECT_ID AND i.index_id = p.index_id
   INNER JOIN sys.allocation_units a ON p.partition_id = a.container_id
   WHERE t.Name = 'FactInternetSales'
   GROUP BY t.Name, p.Rows
   GO
   ```

4. Select **Execute** on the toolbar to run the query to retrieve the size of the `FactInternetSales` table.

   ![The Execute icon is highlighted on the SSMS toolbar.](./media/ssms-toolbar-execute-query.png "Select Execute")

5. In the results pane, note the size of the `FactInternetSales` table.

   ![In the SSMS results pane, the size of the uncompressed FactInternetSales table is highlighted.](media/ssms-query-results-factinternetsales-uncompressed-size.png "Query results")

6. In the Object Explorer, expand Databases, WideWorldImportersDW, and Tables.

7. Right-click the `FactInternetSales` table, select the **Storage** context menu, and then select **Manage Compression** from the fly-out menu.

   ![The FactInternetSales table is selected on the left, Storage is selected and highlighted in the submenu, and Manage Compression is highlighted on the right.](./media/ssms-table-storage-context-menu.png "Select Manage Compression")

8. On the Welcome page of the Data Compression Wizard, select **Next**.

9. On the Select Compression Type page, select **Row** from the Compression Type drop down, and select **Next**.

   ![The Row compression type is highlighted on the Select Compression Type screen of the Data Compression Wizard.](media/ssms-data-compression-wizard-compression-type-row.png "Data Compression Wizard Select Compression Type")

10. On the Select an Output Option page, select **Run immediately**, and then select **Finish >>|**.

    ![Run immediately is highlighted on the Select an Output Option screen of the Data Compression Wizard.](media/ssms-data-compression-wizard-output-row-compression.png "Data Compression Wizard Select an Output Option")

11. Select **Finish** on the Summary page and **Close** when the compression wizard is finished.

    ![The Summary screen of the Data Compression Wizard is displayed.](media/ssms-data-compression-wizard-summary-row-compression.png "Data Compression Wizard Summary")

12. Rerun the query to get the size of the `FactInternetSales` table, noting the reduced size of the table.

    ![In the SSMS results pane, the size of the row compressed FactInternetSales table is highlighted.](media/ssms-query-results-factinternetsales-row-compression-size.png "Query results")

13. Now, repeat steps 7 - 12 above, this time setting the Compression type to Page.

    ![The Page compression type is highlighted on the Select Compression Type screen of the Data Compression Wizard.](media/ssms-data-compression-wizard-compression-type-page.png "Data Compression Wizard Select Compression Type")

14. Once again, observe the table size in the results pane, and compare it to the values noted for the uncompressed table and with Row compression applied.

    ![In the SSMS results pane, the size of the page compressed FactInternetSales table is highlighted.](media/ssms-query-results-factinternetsales-page-compression-size.png "Query results")

15. Both Row and Page compression reduce the size of the table, but Page compression provides the greatest reduction in this case. Compression decreases the load on the Disk I/O subsystem, while increasing the load on the CPU. Since most data warehouse workloads are heavily disk bound, and often have low CPU usage, compression can be a great way to improve performance.

### Task 2: Clustered ColumnStore index

In this task, you will create a new table based on the existing `FactResellerSales` table and apply a ColumnStore index.

1. In SSMS, ensure you are connected to the Azure SQL Database instance.

2. Open a new query window by selecting **New Query** from the toolbar.

   ![The New Query icon is highlighted on the SSMS toolbar.](./media/ssms-toolbar-new-query.png "SSMS New Query")

3. Copy the script below, and paste it into the query window:

   ```sql
   USE WideWorldImportersDW

   SELECT *
   INTO ColumnStore_FactResellerSales
   FROM FactResellerSales
   GO
   ```

4. Select **Execute** on the toolbar to run the query, and create a new table named `ColumnStore_FactResellerSales`, populated with data from the `FactResellerSales` table.

   ![The Execute icon is highlighted on the SSMS toolbar.](./media/ssms-toolbar-execute-query.png "Select Execute")

5. Select **New Query** in the toolbar again, and paste the following query into the new query window. The query contains multiple parts; one to get the size of the `ColumnStore_FactResellerSales` table, a second to create a clustered ColumnStore index on the ColumnStore_FactResellerSales table, and then the size query is repeated to get the size after adding the clustered ColumnStore index.

   ```sql
   USE [WideWorldImportersDW]

   -- Get the Size of the ColumnStore_FactResellerSales table
   SELECT
   t.Name AS TableName,
   p.rows AS RowCounts,
   CAST(ROUND((SUM(a.total_pages) / 128.00), 2) AS NUMERIC(36, 2)) AS Size_MB
   FROM sys.tables t
   INNER JOIN sys.indexes i ON t.OBJECT_ID = i.object_id
   INNER JOIN sys.partitions p ON i.object_id = p.OBJECT_ID AND i.index_id = p.index_id
   INNER JOIN sys.allocation_units a ON p.partition_id = a.container_id
   WHERE t.Name = 'ColumnStore_FactResellerSales'
   GROUP BY t.Name, p.Rows
   GO

   -- Create a clustered columnstore index on the ColumnStore_FactResellerSales table
   CREATE CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX [cci_FactResellerSales]
   ON [dbo].[ColumnStore_FactResellerSales]
   GO

   -- Get the Size of the ColumnStore_FactResellerSales table
   SELECT
   t.Name AS TableName,
   p.rows AS RowCounts,
   CAST(ROUND((SUM(a.total_pages) / 128.00), 2) AS NUMERIC(36, 2)) AS Size_MB
   FROM sys.tables t
   INNER JOIN sys.indexes i ON t.OBJECT_ID = i.object_id
   INNER JOIN sys.partitions p ON i.object_id = p.OBJECT_ID AND i.index_id = p.index_id
   INNER JOIN sys.allocation_units a ON p.partition_id = a.container_id
   WHERE t.Name = 'ColumnStore_FactResellerSales'
   GROUP BY t.Name, p.Rows
   GO
   ```

6. Select **Execute** on the toolbar to run the query.

   >**Note**: You will need to be in SQLCMD mode for all these queries to execute.

7. In the query results, observe the `Size_MB` value of the table before and after the creation of the clustered ColumnStore index. The first value is the size before the index was created, and the second value is the size after the ColumnStore index was created.

   ![The SSMS results pane is displayed, with the size of the ColumnStore_FactResellerSales table highlighted both before and after the creation of the clustered ColumnStore index.](media/ssms-query-results-columnstore-factresellersales-size.png "ColumnStore_FactResellerSales size query results")

8. Create a new query window by selecting **New Query** from the toolbar, and select **Include Actual Execution Plan** by selecting its button in the toolbar.

   ![The Include Actual Execution Plan icon is highlighted on the New Query the toolbar.](./media/ssms-toolbar-include-actual-execution-plan.png "Select the Include Actual Execution Plan")

9. Paste the queries below into the new query window, and select **Execute** on the toolbar:

   ```sql
   SELECT productkey, salesamount
   FROM ColumnStore_FactResellerSales

   SELECT productkey, salesamount
   FROM FactResellerSales
   ```

10. In the Results pane, select the **Execution Plan** tab. Check the (relative to the batch) percentage value of the two queries and compare them.

    ![The Execution Plan tab is highlighted in the Results pane, 6% is highlighted for Query 1, and 94% is highlighted for Query 2.](./media/ssms-query-results-execution-plan-columnstore-index.png "Compare the two queries")

11. Run the same queries again, but this time set statistics IO on in the query by adding the following to the top of the query window:

    ```sql
    SET STATISTICS IO ON
    GO
    ```

12. Your query should look like:

    ![The query includes the above information at the top.](./media/ssms-query-statistics-io.png "Set statistics IO")

13. Select **Execute** from the toolbar to run the query.

14. Statistics IO reports on the amount of logical pages that are read in order to return the query results. Select the **Messages** tab of the Results pane, and compare two numbers, logical reads and lob logical reads. You should see a significant drop in total number of logical reads on the column store-indexed table.

    ![Various information is highlighted on the Messages tab of the Results pane.](./media/ssms-query-results-messages-statistics-io.png "Compare the information")

15. You are now done with the SqlServer2008 VM. Log off of the VM to close the RDP session.
